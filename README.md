# Project Infinity

This project forms a portal of collective NFTs allowing users to mint blocks of NFTs within each portal to create a mosaic of NFTs that form an entire whole. The portals are designed such that one can link NFTs within NFTs to jump from one portal to another, providing a mechanism for one to traverse through endless possibilities and creations through an infinity of NFTs.
